            Irrfan Khan's Last Words
            Irrfan Khan's wife Sutapa Sikdar, son Babil, ex-manager and driver was present in his room. Irrfan said, “Now, I'm certain that I'm going to die. Amma is there in the room. Look, she is sitting by my side, Amma has come to take me away.”

        <h2>Few Words for him </h2>
        <p> Is it a surprise then that his passing away feels as personal — like a reminder of our own mortality?
            The legendary film actor who changed the grammar of acting in Indian cinema passed away due to cancer on 29 April. Irrfan was known for his eyes, the expressiveness, and the stories they told.
            An artist who stayed true to his work and was the most unproblematic celebrity is not with us anymore.
            Something about Irrfan's very being — from his films, from his interviews — seemed always to radiate a wisdom from beyond our world, a joy that surpassed the mundane. His bulbous eyes hinted always at a profundity that in eclipsing the limits of the material he worked with, he somehow managed to improve it.
            Those eyes seemed to hold a thousand emotions that could rise and fall as he willed, sometimes within mere seconds, sometimes at once. He could play a dacoit (Paan Singh Tomar) and somehow, not evoke hate. He could play the madcap owner of a dinosaur theme park (Jurassic World), and somehow, make the job seem relatable. He could help murder someone (Maqbool), and somehow, evoke empathy. This was possible because in playing one of us in a film, he somehow managed to fill the character with every one of us.
